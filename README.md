## Steps in Vscode

#### works with better with this template

1. Install Eslint and prettier extension for vs code.
2. Make Sure Both are enabled
3. Make sure all packages are Installed. (Mostly Eslint and prettier in node_modules)
4. Enable formatOnSave of vs code
5. Open a .tsx file and check if the bottom right corners of vs code have Eslint and Prettier with a double tick
